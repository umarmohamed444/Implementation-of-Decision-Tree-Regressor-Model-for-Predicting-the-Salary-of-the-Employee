# Implementation-of-Decision-Tree-Regressor-Model-for-Predicting-the-Salary-of-the-Employee

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the Decision Tree Regressor Model for Predicting the Salary of the Employee.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.Import pandas as pd and import the required dataset.
Calculate the null values in the dataset.
Import the LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing
Convert the string values to numeric values.
Import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
Assign the train and test dataset.
Import DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree.
Import metrics from sklearn.metrics.
Calculate the MeanSquareError.
Apply the metrics to the dataset.
Predict the output for the required values.
